# the queue handles the notification distributions which the notifiers trigger. The Notifier usually knows what to notify
# and whom to notify. It passes this information to the queue, which strategizes the dispatching. It is more than a singleton;
# it is designed as a single inter-process object. Why? Because one cannot marshall procedures, and this unique inter-process
# object acts as a container for the procedures which will be handled assynchronously by the message queue solution. It is also
# a proxy to the used background queue solution: the queueing basically proxies the queueing somewhere else (Delayed Job, Resque...)
